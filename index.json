I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics and B.A. in Economics from Peking University in 2017.\nMy research lies at the intersection of machine learning, stochastic optimization, and statistics. Specifically, I study the statistical limits of data-driven decision-making, working to understand when and how we can design fast and reliable personalized algorithms. My works draw inspiration from important real-world applications, including healthcare and online platforms.\nI strive to identify cutting-edge problems and generate real-world impact through industry collaborations. In Summer 2021, I worked as a research engineer intern in the Adaptive Experimentation team at Meta, where I developed new methods for multi-objective adaptive experiments. In Summer 2020, I worked as a data scientist intern at Google Play, where I investigated causal models for customer retention.\nI am on the 2022-2023 job market!\nI will be presenting at the 2022 INFORMS Annual Meeting:\n Session: SB56.
